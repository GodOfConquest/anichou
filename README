Note: This is still alpha software. 99% of features are not yet implemented (see the source code for a detailed explanation).
That said, it does work.

To Run:
	./animecollector
	
Dependencies:
	Python:			http://python.org/ 
	GTK:			http://www.gtk.org/
	pyGTK:			http://www.pygtk.org/
	Twisted: 		http://twistedmatrix.com/

Not too many changes since the last release, main one is swapping buzhug for pickling, which should be faster, and means one less dependancy.

For Arch users:
(As root): pacman -S pygtk twisted

For Ubuntu users:
sudo apt-get install pygtk python-twisted

For anyone else:
Do some searches in your package manager, or grab from the sites and compile. Frankly, Python and GTK will be there already 99% of the time (and should be handled as dependancies for pygtk by any package manager).

Note: 
	This is still alpha software. 99% of features are not yet implemented
	(see the source code for a detailed explanation). That said, it does work.

	Package for Ubuntu is in planning.


Installation
============

1. First, you need to make sure the dependencies are met:

	For Ubuntu users: 
		$ sudo apt-get install pygtk python-twisted

	For Arch users: 
		# pacman -S pygtk twisted

	For anyone else: Do some searches in your package manager, or grab from
	the sites and compile. Frankly, Python and GTK will be there already
	99% of the time (and should be handled as dependancies for pygtk by any
	package manager).

2. Build the application

	$ python setup.py build

3. Install the application

	$ sudo python setup.py install
	or
	# python setup.py install

4. Run program

	$ animecollector
